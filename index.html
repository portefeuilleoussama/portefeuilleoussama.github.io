<div style="text-align: justify;">
Not your typical finance portfolio. Iâ€™m not here to impress with buzzwords or perfect credentials. Iâ€™m here because I care deeply about this field, and Iâ€™m doing everything I can to build a future in it, one step at a time.

## Who am I ? (My personal story)

<div style="text-align: justify;">
My passion for finance isnâ€™t theoretical â€” it started in the real world. In March 2020, while markets were collapsing, I turned a $2,500 trading account into over $8,000 in exactly 8 days. You can call it luck, timing, intuition â€” maybe it was all of that. But for me, it was a spark.
</div>

<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Since then, Iâ€™ve kept trading in the background â€” mostly indices and commodities. After my bachelor and a stunt as a financial advisor, I knew I needed more to make it. So I went back to school for my graduate to learn more.

## What Iâ€™m Doing Now

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Iâ€™m a finance student in Montreal trying to break into the finance world. Itâ€™s competitive. Itâ€™s overwhelming. But Iâ€™m not here because itâ€™s easy. Iâ€™m here because I believe I can add value, and Iâ€™m willing to put in the work to prove it. I've passed CFA Level I and I'm preparing for Level II.
</div>
<br>See [CFA credentials](https://credentials.cfainstitute.org/bac09a70-35c6-4d87-aa36-e27cf18d39cb#acc.5faA8k47) and [Exam scores](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bPkyZEJnayXnovZHbgEy9aikAhfsgdnb/view?usp=sharing) <br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Iâ€™ve done an internship at an investment management firm, where I worked on portfolio operations and data analysis. Iâ€™ve built models during my graduate. Iâ€™ve dug through real investment problems. And Iâ€™ve made mistakes â€” but I'm always willing to learn.
</div>
<br>
Iâ€™m learning everything I can:

- Portfolio theory, risk models, valuation  
- Options, derivatives, macro strategies  
- Python, MATLAB, SQL  

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Iâ€™ve also realized that finance is much bigger than just markets and Iâ€™m now also exploring roles in corporate finance, investment banking, and beyond. I donâ€™t have one fixed path. Iâ€™m open to any opportunity where I can keep learning, take on real responsibility, and grow alongside sharp, motivated people, whether itâ€™s in research, strategy, asset management, or something I havenâ€™t even considered yet

## Why this site exists

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Every project here reflects something I was curious about, struggled with, and learned from. Whether itâ€™s:
</div>

- Modeling a portfolioâ€™s risk exposures  
- Running simulations for option pricing  
- Writing Python code that actually works after hours of debugging  

<div style="text-align: justify;">
â€¦It all matters to me. And I hope it matters to someone reading this too.
</div>

## Letâ€™s Talk

<div style="text-align: justify;">
Iâ€™m looking for an internship this fall to complete my Masterâ€™s (Fall 2025 graduate). But more than that, Iâ€™m looking for a shot â€” a place to keep learning, to contribute, and to be part of something real.
